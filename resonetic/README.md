🧠 Resonetic-Core

"My thinking process, now in silicon."

Resonetic-Core is a novel cognitive framework that bridges Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Physical Laws (Fluid Dynamics, Resonance). Unlike traditional AI that relies on statistical correlations, this project attempts to model "meaning" as a physical wave function with phase, amplitude, and topology.


🛠 Core Units (Modules)

🧠 Unit 01: Resonetic Thought Engine

File: resonetic/engine.py

Role: The Mind (Software) - Symbolic & Graph Processing.

Description: A symbolic engine that parses natural language into 4-dimensional R-Grammar layers (Surface, Structural, Topological, Generative). It treats metaphors not as literary devices but as executable operators (e.g., "Vortex" $\rightarrow$ VortexSingularity), constructing a "Geometry of Meaning."

Key Tech: NetworkX, Metaphor Mapping, Topological Graph Theory.

⚡️ Unit 02: Resonetic Transformer

File: resonetic/transformer.py

Role: The Brain (Hardware) - Neural Network Architecture.

Description:
A PyTorch-based neural architecture designed to "think" using physical laws.

Resonance Attention: Replaces standard Dot-Product attention with Phase-Difference bias. (Tokens must "resonate" in phase to attend to each other).

Boundary Layer: Inspired by Burgers' Equation, this layer acts as a shock filter, detecting and resolving cognitive discontinuities (trauma/lies) before output.

🌀 Unit 05: Hybrid Truth Detector

File: hybrid_truth_detector.py

Role: The Application - Real-world Usage.

Description:
A hybrid system combining Riemann Phase Vortex Analysis (Structural Consistency) and Adaptive Anomaly Detection (Time-series Stability) to detect hallucinations or lies in AI-generated text.

🚀 Quick Start

Installation

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Resonetic-Core.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Resonetic-Core.git)
cd Resonetic-Core
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running Unit 01 (Thought Engine)

from resonetic.engine import ResoneticThoughtEngine

engine = ResoneticThoughtEngine()
graph = engine.analyze("Is it possible to code a realignment of the waves?")
engine.visualize(graph) # Displays the Thought Graph


Running Unit 02 (Transformer Architecture)

from resonetic.transformer import ResoneticTransformer
import torch

model = ResoneticTransformer()
dummy_input = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1, 10))
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output['boundary_state']) # Check for cognitive shock
