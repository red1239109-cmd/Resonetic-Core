# Theory

Resonetics explores learning systems under **explicit structural tension**.

The theory does not assume that intelligence emerges from scale alone.
Instead, it examines how *measured constraints* shape representation dynamics.

## Constraint-Driven Learning

Traditional optimization minimizes a loss.
Resonetics introduces **auxiliary pressures** that act orthogonally:

- Stability vs change
- Structure vs entropy
- Local coherence vs global diversity

Learning becomes a negotiation, not a slide downhill.

---

## Resonance

Resonance is treated as *phase alignment* in representation space.
Aligned representations reinforce; misaligned ones attenuate.

This is implemented numerically, not metaphorically.

---

## Entropy as a Control Signal

Entropy is not noise.
It is a **state descriptor** that modulates intervention strength.

Low entropy → allow structured perturbation  
High entropy → enforce conservative behavior

## What This Theory Is Not

- Not a theory of consciousness
- Not an AGI claim
- Not a replacement for standard deep learning

It is a **bounded exploration of dynamics**, nothing more.

---

## Testability

Every theoretical claim in this project is paired with:
- An ablation path
- A measurable signal
- A falsifiable outcome

Unmeasured intuition is treated as non-theory.
