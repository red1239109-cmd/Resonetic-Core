# Philosophy

Resonetics is built on a simple suspicion:

> Unlimited freedom rarely produces meaning.

---

## On Constraint

Constraint is not censorship.
It is the shape that allows motion to exist at all.

A violin string without tension does not sing.

---

## On Stability

Stability is not stasis.
It is the capacity to absorb disturbance without collapse.

Systems that cannot tolerate tension cannot learn.

---

## On Humility

This project assumes:
- Models fail
- Metrics lie
- Elegance can be deceptive

Therefore:
- Logs are favored over claims
- Ablations over narratives
- Limits over hype

---

## Position

Resonetics does not aim to be *right*.
It aims to be **inspectable**.

That alone is enough to justify its existence.
