# Resonetics

**Resonetics** is a research framework exploring *constraint-driven generative systems*.
Rather than maximizing free-form creativity, it investigates how **measured constraints**
produce stability, structure, and meaningful variation in learning systems.

This repository contains experimental architectures and benchmarks that study
how *resonance*, *entropy regulation*, and *structural tension* affect learning dynamics.

## Core Idea

Most generative models ask:

> “How much variation can we allow?”

Resonetics asks instead:

> **“What must remain invariant while change occurs?”**

This shift reframes creativity as a *controlled phenomenon*, not noise.

## Repository Structure

- **EtherVAE**  
  Latent-space experiments exploring entropy-aware modulation and resonance effects.

- **Resonetics Transformer**  
  A transformer variant with resonance-biased attention, boundary layers, and
  uncertainty-weighted auxiliary losses.

- **Benchmarks & Logs**  
  Scientific benchmarks designed for reproducibility, ablation, and reviewer inspection.

---

## Design Principles

- Constraint ≠ Restriction  
- Instability is measured, not forbidden  
- Structure and variation are treated as a *tension*, not a tradeoff  
- Claims are bounded by experiments, not metaphors  

---

## Status

This project is **experimental research code**.
It is not production-ready and does not claim superiority over standard architectures
outside the demonstrated benchmarks.
