# Resonetics
**Engineering Tension, Not Intelligence**

Resonetics is **not an AGI**.  
It is a **dynamical control system** designed to prevent saturation by balancing:

- **Structure** — prevents collapse into chaos (form, constraint)
- **Flow** — prevents freezing and stagnation (continuous change)
- **Tension** — rewards productive contradiction between reality and ideal

> Creativity is not optimization.  
> It is the sustained management of contradiction.

Resonetics does **not** resolve tension.  
It decides **which tensions deserve to live**.

## Core idea (3-second read)

Most AI systems optimize for:
- accuracy
- convergence
- stability

Resonetics asks a different question:

**What should *not* be resolved?**

Premature resolution can destroy:
- adaptability
- creativity
- long-term stability

Contradiction is treated as a **signal**, not a failure.

---

## What Resonetics does

Resonetics focuses on a measurable loop:

1. Detect paradox / contradiction  
2. Measure structural tension  
3. Decide: **preserve**, **ignore**, or **collapse**

This is **rule-based, auditable, and reproducible** — not opinion-driven.

## Repository structure

This repository contains multiple evolutionary versions of the same idea.  
Each version represents **a discarded assumption** and **a cleaner abstraction**.

- **Prophet** — enterprise runtime / system self-protection  
- **Auditor** — structural analyzer (code as living structure)  
- **Via Negativa** — the creative core: subtractive cognition  
- **K8s RL Env** *(optional)* — benchmarking under entropy + budget pressure

🧬 Version lineage / archive: see **[VERSIONS.md](./VERSIONS.md)** *(recommended)*

## Paradox classification

Each paradox is evaluated across measurable dimensions (e.g. tension, coherence, pressure response),
then mapped to a deterministic verdict:

| Type | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `creative_tension` | stable contradiction generating insight | `PRESERVE_AND_FEED` |
| `bubble` | inflated claim without structural support | `IGNORE` |
| `collapse` | internally inconsistent or defensive paradox | `FORCE_COLLAPSE` |

## What this project is NOT

- ❌ Not AGI  
- ❌ Not a consciousness simulation  
- ❌ Not a chatbot  
- ❌ Not claiming emergent intelligence  

Resonetics does not claim intelligence.  
It studies **tension management**.

### Final note

If a computational system ever appears creative,  
it is not because it knows more —

but because it knows what **not** to resolve.
