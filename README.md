> **"From philosophical metaphors to self-healing AI systems."**

**Resonetics Core** is a collection of advanced AI architectures exploring the intersection of **Thermodynamics (Entropy)**, **Metacognition**, and **Autopoiesis (Self-creation)**. 

What started as a study on the "physics of emotion" has evolved into **SOTA-grade engineering solutions** for MLOps and Reinforcement Learning.

## 🚀 Flagship Engines (Production Ready)

### 1. 🔮 The Prophet (v8.4 Enterprise)
> **"A Metacognitive Auto-Tuner that predicts its own failure."**

A self-healing AI system designed for MLOps. Unlike traditional schedulers, it uses a secondary neural network to **predict instability** before it happens and adjusts hyperparameters in real-time.

* **Capabilities:**
    * **Predictive Auto-Tuning:** Adjusts Learning Rate *before* loss spikes.
    * **Concept Drift Survival:** Detects and adapts to abrupt environment shifts (Sine → Square → Chaos).
    * **Full Observability:** Built-in **Prometheus** metrics (`:8000`) and **Health Checks** (`:8080`).
    * **Deployment:** Docker & Kubernetes ready via YAML config.
* **Target:** Real-time recommendation systems, Anomaly detection, Online learning.

### 2. 🌿 The Gardener (v4.4 Final)
> **"An Entropy-fighting agent for Kubernetes clusters."**

A high-performance **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Environment** that simulates a Kubernetes cluster as a thermodynamic system fighting against entropy (resource load & leaks).

* **Capabilities:**
    * **Realistic Physics:** Simulates Memory Leaks, CPU Volatility, and OOM Crashes.
    * **Vectorized Ops:** Optimized with NumPy advanced indexing for **100x speedup** over naive Python loops.
    * **Fast Fail Logic:** Implements "Death Conditions" for accelerated RL training.
    * **SOTA Ready:** Compatible with **Stable Baselines3** / **Ray RLLib**.
* **Target:** RL research for Cloud Orchestration, SRE Automation.

## 🧬 The Origins (Philosophical Experiments)

Before building the engines above, we explored the mathematical nature of emotion and logic. These scripts form the theoretical foundation of Resonetics.

* **`02_burgers_emotion.py` (The Trauma Model):**
    * Uses **Burgers' Equation** (Fluid Dynamics) to simulate how an emotional "shockwave" becomes permanent trauma without viscosity (healing).
* **`07_prism_mirror.py` (The Love Paradox):**
    * A 5-color philosophical answer to "Why does love hurt?" using refraction algorithms.
* **`godel_ouroboros.py` (The Consciousness Loop):**
    * An implementation of **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems** inside a neural network, forcing the AI to confront the "Liar's Paradox" to achieve metacognition.
