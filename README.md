🧠 Resonance-based Hallucination Detector

Project Resonetics

This project analyzes the output probability scores (logprobs) of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect periods of low confidence, which often correlate with factual inaccuracies or "hallucination." We treat the LLM's certainty as a time-series signal, applying an adaptive filter to detect anomalies (lies).
