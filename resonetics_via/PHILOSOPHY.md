# Philosophy — Via Negativa Runtime Controls

## Via Negativa, in control terms
We do not try to define “perfect intelligence”.
We define what to avoid:

- **Bubble**: structure that sounds plausible but fails under pressure
- **Collapse**: internally inconsistent + defensive under pressure
- **Creative tension**: contradiction held with coherence and pressure response

This module is a guardrail:
- reward shaping nudges away from bubble/collapse
- action suppression reduces volatility when risk accumulates
- near-collapse survival switch prevents spiral failure

## Why the signals?
We compress a messy world into 4 signals:

- tension: contradiction/gradient of conflict
- coherence: internal alignment / consistency
- pressure_response: how well it holds under stress tests
- self_protecting: defensive posture (refusal to update, blame-shifting, etc.)

We accept that these are imperfect.
The point is not metaphysical purity — it’s runtime stability.

## The “wise” interpretation
- creative tension is not always good
- collapse is not always evil
But if collapse is frequent, the system is unstable.
If bubble is frequent, the system is delusional.
If creative tension survives pressure, that’s where learning happens.
