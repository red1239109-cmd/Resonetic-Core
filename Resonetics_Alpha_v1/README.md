# Resonetics Alpha v1: Sovereign AGI Core

> **"Thought Encoded in Resonance."**
> An experimental cognitive architecture that embeds physical laws, structural constraints, and meta-cognition into differentiable mathematics.

## 🌌 Vision: The Sovereign Intelligence Principle
**Resonetics** challenges the paradigm of data-driven imitation learning. Instead, it proposes a **"Constitutional Intelligence"** — an AI governed by an internal constitution of 8 immutable laws, encoded directly into its loss landscape.

Unlike traditional models that learn *what* to think from data, Resonetics learns *how* to think from first principles.

## 🧬 The 8-Layer Cognitive Architecture
At its core lies the `SovereignLoss` function — a multi-objective optimizer that trains the model on 8 simultaneous dimensions of reasoning:

### **I. Physical Resonance (The World's Grammar)**
* **L1 | Gravity:** Attraction to empirical truth `(μ - target)²`
* **L2 | Wave Nature:** Imposition of sinusoidal periodicity `sin(2πμ/3)²`
* **L3 | Boundary Conditions:** Survival threshold enforcement `ReLU(1.5 - μ)²`
* **L4 | Lattice Alignment:** Microscopic structural coherence `sin(πμ)²`

### **II. Logical Crystallization (The Mind's Structure)**
* **L5 | Quantization:** The "Rule of 3" — forcing discrete, decisive reasoning `(μ - round(μ/3)*3)²`
* **L6 | Vital Entropy:** Anti-collapse mechanism preventing cognitive rigidity `-log(L₅ + ε)`

### **III. Meta-Cognitive Layer (The Self's Reflection)**
* **L7 | Temporal Consistency:** Identity preservation through time `|μₜ - μₜ₋₁|`
* **L8 | Epistemic Humility:** Confidence calibration via uncertainty output `-N(μ, σ).entropy()`

## ⚙️ Technical Innovation
* **🧠 Dual-Head Architecture:** Separates **belief** (μ) from **confidence** (σ)
* **⚖️ Autonomous Weight Balancing:** Self-adjusting layer importance via homoscedastic uncertainty
* **📈 Live Cognitive Monitoring:** Real-time visualization of thought evolution

## 🔬 Experimental Results
The system demonstrates:
1. **Structured Convergence:** Target-seeking while respecting physical constraints
2. **Self-Regulating Uncertainty:** Adaptive confidence levels in predictions
3. **Identity Preservation:** Stable reasoning patterns over time
