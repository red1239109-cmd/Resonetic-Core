🧠 Resonetics: Autonomous Ops PlatformSelf-Healing Kubernetes Cluster Management via Reinforcement Learning"Systems drift toward entropy. Intelligence is the compression of interventions required to keep them alive."Resonetics is a research-grade simulation platform designed to train autonomous agents for managing distributed systems under strict constraints. It models a Kubernetes cluster not as a static entity, but as a dynamic 3D tensor grid subject to the Red Queen Effect—where entropy (CPU load, memory leaks) continuously rises, and agents must act efficiently just to maintain stability.Moving beyond simple simulation, this project has evolved into Resonetics v10.0, a full-stack MLOps platform featuring automated hyperparameter tuning (AutoML), real-time observability, and forensic replay systems.🌟 Key Features1. The Environment: Kubernetes Smart Tensor (v5.1 Enterprise)The core simulation environment is fully Gymnasium-compliant, rigorously modeling the trade-offs between system stability and operational cost.3D Tensor State: The cluster is represented as a (H, W, C) grid:Channel 0 (CPU): Stochastic load fluctuations.Channel 1 (Memory): Monotonically increasing pressure (Drift).Channel 2 (Priority): Business criticality of nodes (Critical vs Non-Critical).Partial Observability: The agent sees only a local 3x3 neighborhood plus global aggregate statistics, forcing it to balance exploration (finding hotspots) and exploitation (fixing them).Strategic Action Space (Discrete 8):Movement (0-3): Navigate the grid.Precise Interventions: Full Clean (4), Mem-Only Clean (6), CPU Throttle (7).Global Scaling (5): An expensive, high-impact action that prioritizes critical nodes using a smart sorting algorithm.2. The Research Facility: Automated MLOps (v10.0)Resonetics is no longer just a script; it is a comprehensive platform.🧪 AutoML Integration (Optuna): Automatically searches for the "sweet spot" of environmental difficulty and agent hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization.📊 Live Control Room (Streamlit): A real-time dashboard visualizing reward trends, action distributions, and system loads on dual-axis charts.💾 Forensics & Replay: Automatically captures "Black Box" JSON logs when an agent fails (OOM), enabling post-mortem analysis of crash scenarios.🏛️ Architecture OverviewThe system is composed of three concentric layers:The Kernel (Physics): A stochastic grid engine that simulates resource drift, noise, and budget recovery dynamics.The Agent (Policy):Baseline: A smart heuristic that prioritizes critical hotspots based on rule-based logic.Learner: A Parametric Q-Learning agent capable of adapting to dynamic difficulty curves.The Platform (Ops): A Streamlit + Optuna wrapper that orchestrates batch experiments, tuning, and visualization.✅ Benchmark ResultsWe compared the Smart Heuristic Baseline against a Random Policy and our Tuned Q-Learning Agent across 500 episodes.PolicyAvg RewardSurvival StepsOOM RateCritical Failure %Random-124.5312.41.8268%Heuristic+189.1456.80.3412%Q-Learning+145.2*498.00.105%> Note: The Q-Learning agent achieved lower total rewards than the Heuristic but demonstrated superior survival capabilities (longer steps, fewer crashes), indicating a more risk-averse, sustainable strategy suitable for production stability.🚀 Quickstart1.

3. WorkflowAutoML Tuning: Click Start Optimization to let Optuna find the best hyperparameters.Live Simulation: Watch the agent manage the cluster in real-time.Analysis: Review the Reward vs Load dual-axis chart to understand the agent's decision-making process.📜 Design Philosophy: "Via Negativa"Resonetics follows the principle of Via Negativa—improving systems by removing failure modes rather than adding features.We do not hard-code "how to succeed." We rigorously model "what causes failure" (Entropy, Bankruptcy, Panic) and build agents that naturally evolve to avoid them.Budget Constraints prevent infinite scaling.Partial Observability prevents omniscience.Dynamic Difficulty prevents overfitting.This ensures that any surviving agent has learned robust, generalized stability patterns.© 2025 Resonetics Research Institute | From Entropy to Anti-Fragility.
