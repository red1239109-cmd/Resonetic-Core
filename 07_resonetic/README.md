🌌 Unit 07: Riemann Visualizer (The Foundation)

File: resonetic/riemann_visualizer.py

Role: The Ground Truth (Math) - Mathematical Verification.

Description:
The core mathematical engine that visualizes the Riemann Zeta Function using high-precision arithmetic (mpmath). It proves the existence of "Phase Vortices" at non-trivial zeros and maps the "Resonance Density" along the critical line, serving as the theoretical basis for all other units.
