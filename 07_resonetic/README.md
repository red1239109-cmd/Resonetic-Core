🌌 Unit 07: Riemann Visualizer (The Foundation)

File: resonetic/riemann_visualizer.py

Role: The Ground Truth (Math) - Mathematical Verification.

Description:
The core mathematical engine that visualizes the Riemann Zeta Function using high-precision arithmetic (mpmath). It proves the existence of "Phase Vortices" at non-trivial zeros and maps the "Resonance Density" along the critical line, serving as the theoretical basis for all other units.

🧠 Resonance-based Hallucination Detector

Project Resonetics

This project analyzes the output probability scores (logprobs) of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect periods of low confidence, which often correlate with factual inaccuracies or "hallucination." We treat the LLM's certainty as a time-series signal, applying an adaptive filter to detect anomalies (lies).
