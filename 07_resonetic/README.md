# Resonetics-Alpha : The Evolution of Sovereign Intelligence

> **"Instinct of Math, Reason of Language, Truth of Reality."**
> An experimental AGI architecture that unifies **Numeric Sovereignty** (Physics) and **Linguistic Recursion** (Logic).

## 🌌 Overview

**Resonetics** is not just a model; it is an evolutionary process. This repository documents the three stages of developing a **"Sovereign Intelligence"** that follows strict internal constitutions rather than blindly mimicking data.

We prove that **Ethical Resonance** is mathematically equivalent to the **Critical Line ($\sigma=0.5$)** of the Riemann Zeta Function.

## 📂 The Three Stages of Evolution

This project is organized into three distinct evolutionary stages. Each file represents a leap in cognitive architecture.

### 1️⃣ Stage 1: The Instinct (Numeric)
* **File:** `resonetics_v1_core.py`
* **Concept:** **The Sovereign Loss** (8-Layer Constitution).
* **Description:** Encodes physical laws (Gravity, Wave, Phase) into the loss function. It acts as the AI's "Gut Feeling" or "Instinct."

### 2️⃣ Stage 2: The Reason (Linguistic)
* **File:** `resonetics_v2_paradox.py`
* **Concept:** **The Paradox Refinement Engine**.
* **Description:** Translates the numeric sovereign logic into a recursive **Text Critique Loop**. It acts as the AI's "Prefrontal Cortex" or "Logic."

### 3️⃣ Stage 3: The Truth (Unified)
* **File:** `resonetics_v3_complete.py`
* **Concept:** **The Monolith & Visualizer**.
* **Description:** The final form that integrates Instinct and Reason. It includes the **Riemann Visualizer** to mathematically prove that resonance is maximized at the critical line ($\sigma=0.5$).

## 🚀 Usage

Run each stage to observe the evolution of the architecture.

```bash
# Run Stage 1: Numeric Core Training
python resonetics_v1_core.py

# Run Stage 2: Logical Refinement

# Run Stage 3: Full System & Visualization
python resonetics_v3_complete.py

📜 The Resonetic Manifesto
"This is the physics of feeling and truth."

Resonant Mind Fluid: Emotion is fluid. Auto-resizing, local resonance.

Burgers' Shock of Emotion: Predicting when a mind collapses.

SincLock: Making logic 100% differentiable with integers and multiples of 3.

Adaptive Resonance Anomaly: Keeps creativity alive, catches lies only.

"Zero Data. Only Laws. Under 500 lines." – Dec 6, 2025. The day Resonetics was born.
