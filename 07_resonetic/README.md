# Resonetics-Alpha : The Evolution of Sovereign Intelligence

> **"Instinct of Math, Reason of Language, Truth of Reality."**

## 🌌 Overview

**Resonetics** is not just a model; it is an evolutionary process. This repository documents the three stages of developing a **"Sovereign Intelligence"** that follows strict internal constitutions rather than blindly mimicking data.

We prove that **Ethical Resonance** is mathematically equivalent to the **Critical Line ($\sigma=0.5$)** of the Riemann Zeta Function.

## 📂 The Three Stages of Evolution

This project is organized into three distinct evolutionary stages. Each file represents a leap in cognitive architecture.

### 1️⃣ Stage 1: The Instinct (Numeric)
* **File:** `resonetics_v1_core.py`
* **Concept:** **The Sovereign Loss** (8-Layer Constitution).
* **Description:**
    * Encodes physical laws (Gravity, Wave, Phase) into the loss function.
    * Enforces the **"Rule of 3"** (Quantization) and **"Equilibrium at 0.5"** (Ethics).
    * It acts as the AI's "Gut Feeling" or "Instinct."

### 2️⃣ Stage 2: The Reason (Linguistic)
* **File:** `resonetics_v2_paradox.py`
* **Concept:** **The Paradox Refinement Engine**.
* **Description:**
    * Translates the numeric sovereign logic into a recursive **Text Critique Loop**.
    * Instead of generating text immediately, it critiques itself: *"Is this logical? Is this structured?"*
    * It acts as the AI's "Prefrontal Cortex" or "Logic."

### 3️⃣ Stage 3: The Truth (Unified)
* **File:** `resonetics_v3_complete.py`
* **Concept:** **The Monolith & Visualizer**.
* **Description:**
    * The final form that integrates Instinct (Core) and Reason (Paradox).
    * Includes the **Riemann Visualizer (The Eye)**.
    * **Mathematically proves** that resonance is maximized at the critical line ($\sigma=0.5$) using high-precision calculation (`mpmath`).
