# EXPERIMENT_LOG_EXAMPLE.md

## Purpose

This document explains **how to read and interpret experiment logs** generated by the Resonetics project.

Resonetics logs are not simple loss traces.  
They are **state-transition records** that capture how the system detects instability and responds to it.

This guide is intended for **reviewers, researchers, and engineers** evaluating the system’s behavior.

---

## Logging Philosophy

Logs in Resonetics exist to answer the following questions:

- Is the system currently **stable**?
- Was instability **predicted or only observed after the fact**?
- Were corrective actions **preventive or reactive**?
- Did learning continue **without collapse**?

For this reason, logs are **decision traces**, not performance dashboards.

## Basic Log Format

### Prophet System Log Example

```text
Step   500/2000 | Risk: 0.083 | Error: 0.00231 | LR: 0.00612 | ✅ CRUISE | 412.5 steps/sec
````

Each field has the following meaning:

| Field                              | Description                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Step 500/2000`                    | Current training step / total steps |
| `Risk`                             | Predicted instability score (0–1)   |
| `Error`                            | Actual task error (MSE)             |
| `LR`                               | Effective learning rate             |
| `CRUISE / WARNING / ALERT / PANIC` | System operating mode               |
| `steps/sec`                        | Throughput (informational only)     |

## Key Interpretation Point ①

### Risk and Error Are Not the Same

A critical distinction:

* **Error** measures damage that has already occurred.
* **Risk** estimates the likelihood of near-future instability.

### Desired behavior

```text
Risk ↑  →  LR ↓  →  Error remains bounded
```

### Undesirable behavior

```text
Error ↑  →  Risk reacts late  →  Collapse already happened
```

Resonetics is explicitly designed to avoid the second pattern.

## Key Interpretation Point ②

### Mode Transitions Are Safety Signals

Operating modes represent **system safety state**, not performance.

| Mode      | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `CRUISE`  | Stable learning regime                   |
| `WARNING` | Early instability detected               |
| `ALERT`   | Active learning-rate correction          |
| `PANIC`   | Emergency intervention to avoid collapse |

Important evaluation rule:

* The goal is **not** to eliminate `PANIC` entirely ❌
* The goal is to ensure `PANIC` states are **brief and recoverable** ✅

---

## Key Interpretation Point ③

### Good Logs vs. Bad Logs

#### ❌ Poor-quality logs

* Risk remains near zero at all times
* Learning rate barely changes
* Error spikes without preemptive response

→ Meta-cognition is effectively inactive.

#### ✅ High-quality logs

* Risk increases **before** error escalation
* Learning rate adapts smoothly
* Modes transition `WARNING → CRUISE` after recovery

→ The system detects, reasons, and responds.

---

## Checkpoint Logs

Each checkpoint stores the following information:

```python
{
  'step': step,
  'error': error,
  'worker_state': ...,
  'predictor_state': ...,
  'optimizer_state': ...,
  'prophet_stats': {...},
  'timestamp': ...
}
```

Review checklist:

* Did `predictor_state` evolve during training?
* Are operating modes distributed (not stuck in one mode)?
* Did the system maintain bounded error even when improvement stalled?

---

## EtherVAE Log Interpretation (Summary)

For EtherVAE experiments, evaluation focuses on **relative comparisons**, not absolute values.

Key question:

* Does the Resonetics mode behave differently across entropy regimes?

Expected pattern:

* Low entropy → smoother local behavior
* High entropy → conservative deformation, avoiding instability

This indicates **entropy-aware constraint modulation** is active.

---

## What These Logs Demonstrate

Resonetics logs are not meant to prove:

* “The model is smarter” ❌
* “The model achieves higher scores” ❌

They are meant to demonstrate:

> **The system detected its own instability,
> adjusted itself accordingly,
> and avoided catastrophic failure.**

Crucially, this behavior is **auditable and reproducible**.

---

## One-Line Summary

> These logs do not record outcomes.
> They record **judgment under constraint**.
