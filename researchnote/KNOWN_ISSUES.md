# KNOWN ISSUES

This document lists **known limitations and open issues** in the Resonetics project.
They are documented intentionally for transparency, auditability, and research integrity.

Resonetics treats limitations as **measurable constraints**, not defects to be hidden.

---

## 1. This System Does Not Discover Truth

**Status:** By design

Resonetics does **not** determine whether a statement is true or false.

It evaluates:
- internal tension
- structural coherence
- behavior under pressure

A claim classified as *creative tension* may still be factually wrong.
Conversely, a true statement may collapse if it is incoherent or defensive.

**Mitigation:**  
Truth verification must be handled by external systems (experiments, datasets, peer review).

---

## 2. Metrics Are Heuristic, Not Universal

**Status:** Expected limitation

The core signals (`tension`, `coherence`, `pressure_response`, `self_protecting`)
are heuristic measurements.

They are:
- deterministic
- interpretable
- reproducible  

But **not mathematically complete** or domain-universal.

Different domains (science, philosophy, engineering) may require recalibration.

**Mitigation:**  
All thresholds and weights are explicitly configurable and logged.

---

## 3. No Semantic Understanding Guarantee

**Status:** Inherent constraint

Resonetics does not “understand” meaning in a human sense.

It observes **structural behavior**, not semantics:
- contradiction patterns
- response stability
- defensive collapse signals

High coherence does not imply semantic depth.

**Mitigation:**  
Use Resonetics as a **filter**, not a final judge.

---

## 4. Creative Energy Accumulation Is Non-Optimal

**Status:** Known inefficiency

Creative energy accumulation is intentionally conservative.

This avoids runaway amplification but may:
- under-reward subtle insights
- delay long-term evolution

**Mitigation:**  
Future versions may include decay functions or adaptive accumulation rates.

---

## 5. Bubble Detection Is Context-Sensitive

**Status:** Partial coverage

Some ideas classified as `bubble` may later prove valuable
once external conditions change.

Resonetics evaluates **current structural validity**, not future utility.

**Mitigation:**  
All discarded states are logged and recoverable via lineage tags.

---

## 6. Collapse Does Not Mean “Wrong”

**Status:** Common misunderstanding

A `collapse` verdict indicates:
- internal inconsistency
- defensive self-protection
- failure under pressure

It does **not** imply the idea is false or useless.

**Mitigation:**  
Collapsed ideas can be reintroduced with modified constraints.

---

## 7. Not Designed for Real-Time Safety Decisions

**Status:** Explicit non-goal

Resonetics is **not** suitable for:
- medical decisions
- autonomous control
- safety-critical real-time systems

It is a **research and evaluation framework**, not a control system.

---

## 8. This Is Not AGI (And Cannot Become One Accidentally)

**Status:** Architectural guarantee

Resonetics:
- has no self-directed goal formation
- has no persistent world model
- has no autonomous action loop

It cannot evolve into AGI through parameter tuning or scale.

This limitation is **intentional and permanent**.

---

## Summary

Resonetics is a system for:
- measuring contradiction
- filtering creative tension
- preventing conceptual collapse

It is **not** a system for:
- producing intelligence
- asserting truth
- replacing human judgment

Documenting these limitations is a design choice, not a weakness.
