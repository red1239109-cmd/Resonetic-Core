# Resonetics

**Engineering Tension, Not Intelligence**

Resonetics is **not an AGI** and does not attempt to simulate human intelligence.

Instead, it explores how **tension, contradiction, and uncertainty** can be
**measured, classified, and transformed into creative energy**
inside computational systems.

This repository contains **three evolutionary versions of a single idea**,
developed sequentially as understanding deepened.

---

## Core Idea

Most AI systems optimize for:

- accuracy  
- convergence  
- stability  

Resonetics asks a different question:

> **What if sustained tension — not resolution — is the source of creativity?**

Instead of forcing contradictions to collapse, Resonetics:

- detects paradox  
- measures its structural properties  
- decides whether it should be **fed, ignored, or collapsed**

The system does not seek answers.  
It evaluates **which contradictions deserve to survive**.

## Repository Structure (Three Versions)

### 1. Prophet — Enterprise Runtime

**File:**  
`resonetics_prophet_v8_4_1_enterprise_clean.py`

A production-grade experimental system featuring:

- risk prediction  
- adaptive learning-rate modulation  
- monitoring (Prometheus / health checks)  
- resilience under concept drift  

**Purpose**

Demonstrate **system-level metacognition**, not creativity itself.

This version answers:

> *“How can a system protect itself while learning?”*

---

### 2. Auditor — Structural Analyzer

**File:**  
`resonetics_auditor_v6_5_hardened.py`

A static analysis tool that:

- inspects Python source code via AST  
- scores structure, complexity, resilience, async usage  
- highlights architectural tension and risk  

**Purpose**

Evaluate code as a **living structure**, not style compliance.

This version answers:

> *“Is this system structurally honest?”*

---

### 3. Via Negativa — Creative Core

**File:**  
`resonetics_via_negativa_v1_1_runtime_fixed.py`

The conceptual heart of the project.

Implements **subtractive cognition**:

- unlearning compulsion  
- paradox acceptance  
- humility derived from uncertainty  
- integration instead of fragmentation  

Includes:

- paradox classification  
  (`creative_tension / bubble / collapse`)  
- energy computation  
- action verdicts  
  (`PRESERVE_AND_FEED / IGNORE / FORCE_COLLAPSE`)  

**Purpose**

Explore **idea evolution**, not task performance.

This version answers:

> *“Which contradictions deserve to live?”*

---

## Paradox Classification Logic

Each paradox is evaluated across four dimensions:

- **tension** — contradiction intensity  
- **coherence** — internal structural consistency  
- **pressure_response** — behavior under stress  
- **self_protecting** — evasive or defensive behavior  

Resulting in a deterministic verdict:

| Type              | Meaning                                              | Action              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| creative_tension  | Stable contradiction generating insight               | PRESERVE_AND_FEED   |
| bubble             | Inflated claim without structural support            | IGNORE              |
| collapse           | Incoherent or self-protective paradox                | FORCE_COLLAPSE      |

This process is **rule-based, auditable, and reproducible**.  
It is not opinion-driven.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not AGI  
- ❌ Not consciousness simulation  
- ❌ Not a chatbot  
- ❌ Not claiming intelligence emergence  

Resonetics does **not think**.

It filters **which thoughts are worth evolving**.

---

## Why Three Versions?

Because understanding evolved.

Each version represents:

- a discarded assumption  
- a removed illusion  
- a cleaner abstraction  

This is **intentional lineage**, not indecision.

---

## Philosophy

Resonetics follows **Via Negativa**:

> “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add,  
> but when there is nothing left to take away.”  
> — *Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

Instead of asking:

> *“What should AI become?”*

Resonetics asks:

> *“What should be removed?”*

## Final Note

If an AI system ever appears creative,  
it is not because it knows more —  

but because it knows **what not to resolve**.
