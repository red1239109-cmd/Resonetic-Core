# Resonetics

**Constraint-Grounded Reasoning Systems**
*Stability emerges from measured tension, not from unconstrained freedom.*

---

## Overview

**Resonetics** is a research-oriented project exploring how **constraints, uncertainty, and internal tension** can be explicitly modeled inside AI systems—both numeric and linguistic—without collapsing into rigid rules or unconstrained generation.

This repository contains **multiple independent but philosophically aligned modules**, each operating at a different abstraction layer:

* Numeric optimization (PyTorch, differentiable systems)
* Structural reasoning (model auditing, constraint diagnostics)
* Linguistic refinement (recursive critique loops)

> **Important:**
> This is a *research prototype*, not a production-ready framework.
> Claims are intentionally scoped, and limitations are explicitly documented.

## Core Modules

### 1. Resonetics Alpha (Grandmaster Series)

**File:**
`resonetics_alpha_grandmaster_v4_2_flow_structure_tension.py`

**Purpose:**
A minimal but expressive simulation of **constraint-driven decision making**, where:

* **Reality** (target values),
* **Structure** (preferred forms),
* **Flow** (change / oscillation),
* **Tension** (conflict between reality and structure)

are jointly optimized via a multi-layer loss system.

**Key Concepts**

* Multi-objective loss with **learned uncertainty weighting**
* Explicit modeling of **flow vs structure vs tension**
* EMA teacher for temporal self-consistency
* Designed for *analysis*, not benchmark performance

---

### 2. Resonetic Transformer (Unit 02)

**Files:**

* `resonetics_transformer_v3_3_uncertainty.py`

**Purpose:**
A Transformer variant that injects **structural and philosophical constraints** directly into attention and auxiliary losses.

**Key Features**

* Resonance-biased attention (phase-distance penalty)
* R-Grammar semantic projection (S/R/T/G)
* Boundary layers as internal stability estimators
* Auxiliary losses grounded in measurable internal signals

---

### 3. Paradox Refinement Engine (Linguistic Layer)

**Files:**

* `resonetics_v2_paradox.py`

**Purpose:**
A **language-side counterpart** to numeric constraint optimization.

Instead of gradients, it uses a **recursive critique loop** to stabilize text generation via:

* Structural constraints (Rule of Three)
* Boundary detection (logic flips, paradox)
* Confidence-weighted convergence

> There is **no shared training loop** with numeric models.
> The relationship is *conceptual*, not operational.

### 4. Resonetics Auditor

**Files:**

* `resonetics_auditor_v6_5_hardened.py`

**Purpose:**
A structural analysis tool that evaluates Python code through:

* Function length distributions
* Cyclomatic complexity
* Error-handling resilience
* Async feature usage

Designed to **diagnose structural risk**, not enforce style.

## Experiments & Benchmarks

**What is evaluated**

* Standard VAE vs Ether-modulated inference
* Entropy-sensitive behavior
* Local smoothness & manifold quality
* Statistical significance (paired tests)

**Outputs**

## Known Limitations (Short Version)

* Not benchmarked against large-scale SOTA models
* Many hyperparameters are **exploratory**
* Attention mechanisms remain O(L²)
* Claims are **local and scoped**, not AGI-level

### Final Note

This repository is **not about maximizing output**.

It asks a different question:

> *What must remain stable while change occurs?*

If that question resonates, you’re reading the code correctly.
