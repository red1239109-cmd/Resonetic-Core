## How to Read the Experiment Logs

This document explains **how to interpret the experiment outputs** generated by the Resonetics benchmarks.
It is intended for **reviewers, testers, and collaborators** who want to understand *what is measured*, *why it is measured*, and *what conclusions are (and are not) justified*.

---

## 1. Directory Structure

Each run automatically creates a timestamped directory:

```
runs/
└── 2025-01-12_21-34-08_ethervae_v6/
    ├── config.json
    ├── train_log.jsonl
    ├── metrics.json
    ├── stats_tests.json
    ├── samples_grid.png
    ├── entropy_response.png
    └── recon_kl_tradeoff.png
```

Each file has a **single, well-defined role**.

---

## 2. `config.json` — Experimental Conditions

This file records **all parameters required for reproducibility**:

* Model architecture (latent dimension, layers)
* Training parameters (epochs, learning rate, β for β-VAE)
* Random seeds
* Enabled modes (`standard`, `ether`, `resonetics`)

**How to read it**

* If two runs differ here, they are **not directly comparable**
* Reviewers should always check this file first

---

## 3. `train_log.jsonl` — Training Dynamics

A JSON Lines file, one entry per epoch.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "epoch": 7,
  "train_loss": 138.21,
  "val_loss": 142.09,
  "kl_loss": 31.88,
  "recon_loss": 110.33
}
```

**What it shows**

* Convergence behavior
* Stability vs over-regularization
* KL collapse or explosion

**What it does NOT claim**

* No claim of optimality
* No claim of SOTA performance

---

## 4. `metrics.json` — Core Quantitative Results

This file summarizes **post-training analysis**, including:

* Local latent smoothness (mean ± std)
* Global manifold diversity
* Latent space utilization statistics
* Mode-wise comparisons

Example (simplified):

```json
{
  "smoothness": {
    "standard": 0.0048,
    "ether": 0.0061,
    "resonetics": 0.0039
  }
}
```

**How to interpret**

* Lower smoothness = more locally stable manifold
* Differences are **comparative**, not absolute quality scores

---

## 5. `stats_tests.json` — Statistical Significance

Contains paired statistical tests (typically paired t-tests):

* Mean differences
* p-values
* Effect sizes (Cohen’s d)

Example:

```json
{
  "standard_vs_resonetics": {
    "p_value": 0.008,
    "cohens_d": 0.64
  }
}
```

**Important**

* Statistical significance ≠ practical superiority
* Results are **context-bound to this dataset and setup**

---

## 6. Visual Outputs

### `samples_grid.png`

Side-by-side reconstructions:

* Same latent input
* Different inference modes

Used to assess:

* Structural consistency
* Mode-specific artifacts
* Qualitative smoothness

---

### `entropy_response.png`

Shows how inference modes respond to **changing entropy levels** (log-variance).

**Key question it answers**

> Does the system respond smoothly and predictably as uncertainty increases?

Not:

> “Which mode is more creative?”

---

### `recon_kl_tradeoff.png`

Illustrates the reconstruction–regularization tradeoff.

Used to verify:

* No hidden KL collapse
* Comparable operating regimes across baselines

---

## 7. What Conclusions Are Allowed

✔ Allowed:

* “Mode A is smoother than Mode B under these conditions”
* “Entropy-sensitive modulation behaves nonlinearly”
* “Differences are statistically detectable in this setup”

✘ Not Allowed:

* Claims of general intelligence
* Claims of universal superiority
* Claims beyond tested distributions

---

## 8. Design Philosophy Behind Logging

The logging system follows three principles:

1. **Reproducibility over performance**
2. **Explicit limits over implicit claims**
3. **Comparative clarity over single-number scores**

Logs are meant to support **reasoned discussion**, not marketing.

---

## Summary

These logs answer one question:

> *How does constraint-aware modulation change model behavior under controlled conditions?*

They intentionally **do not answer** broader or speculative questions.

* `THEORY.md`
* `PHILOSOPHY.md`

For limitations, see:

* `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
