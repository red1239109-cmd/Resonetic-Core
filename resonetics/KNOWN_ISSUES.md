# Known Issues and Limitations

This document lists known limitations, open design questions,
and deliberate constraints in the Resonetics project.

These are **acknowledged**, **intentional**, and **non-hidden**.

---

## 1. This Is Not AGI

Resonetics does not:
- reason autonomously
- form goals
- understand semantics
- possess agency or awareness

Any appearance of creativity emerges from **rule-based tension handling**, not intelligence.

---

## 2. Paradox Metrics Are Heuristic

Metrics such as:
- tension
- coherence
- pressure_response

are **designed signals**, not objective truths.

They are useful for comparative analysis, not absolute judgment.

---

## 3. Energy Is Not “Creativity”

The `energy` score represents:
- persistence under contradiction
- capacity for structured evolution

It does **not** represent imagination, originality, or insight.

---

## 4. Threshold Sensitivity

Classification boundaries (creative vs bubble vs collapse) depend on thresholds.

While deterministic, these thresholds:
- may require domain-specific tuning
- can bias classification if misused

This is a known tradeoff.

---

## 5. No Ground Truth Validation

There is no external oracle that confirms whether a paradox
*should* be preserved or collapsed.

The system evaluates **internal structure only**.

---

## 6. No Learning Across Runs (By Design)

Resonetics does not:
- accumulate long-term memory
- update its own rules
- self-modify decision logic

This is intentional to preserve auditability.

---

## 7. Over-Interpretation Risk

Because outputs are linguistically rich, users may:
- anthropomorphize results
- attribute intention or meaning

This is a user-side risk, not a system capability.

---

## 8. Enterprise Runtime ≠ Creative Core

The Prophet (enterprise runtime) focuses on:
- stability
- risk mitigation
- system protection

It does not generate ideas.
Creativity-related mechanisms live only in Via Negativa.

---

## 9. Research Prototype Status

This repository contains:
- experimental code
- conceptual architectures
- research tools

It is **not** production AI and makes no deployment claims.

---

## Summary

Resonetics is intentionally constrained.

Its value lies in:
- transparency
- falsifiability
- structural honesty

Not in claims of intelligence.
